Timeliness references whether information is available when it is expected and needed. Timeliness of data is very important. This is reflected in:

Companies that are required to publish their quarterly results within a given frame of time
Customer service providing up-to date information to the customers
Credit system checking in real-time on the credit card account activity
The timeliness depends on user expectation. Online availability of data could be required for room allocation system in hospitality, but nightly data could be perfectly acceptable for a billing system.

As you can see, data quality is an important issue that should be considered â€“ starting with initial application design, all the way through implementation, maintenance and use. In future blog posts, we will discuss techniques for addressing these types of data quality issues.
