Completeness is defined as expected comprehensiveness. Data can be complete even if optional data is missing. As long as the data meets the expectations then the data is considered complete.

For example, a customerâ€™s first name and last name are mandatory but middle name is optional; so a record can be considered complete even if a middle name is not available.

Questions you can ask yourself: Is all the requisite information available? Do any data values have missing elements? Or are they in an unusable state?
