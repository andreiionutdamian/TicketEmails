Accuracy is the degree to which data correctly reflects the real world object OR an event being described. Examples:

Sales of the business unit are the real value.
Address of an employee in the employee database is the real address.
Questions you can ask yourself: Do data objects accurately represent the “real world” values they are expected to model? Are there incorrect spellings of product or person names, addresses, and even untimely or not current data?
These issues can impact operational and advanced analytics applications.
