Conformity means the data is following the set of standard data definitions like data type, size and format. For example, date of birth of customer is in the format “mm/dd/yyyy”

Questions you can ask yourself: Do data values comply with the specified formats? If so, do all the data values comply with those formats?
Maintaining conformance to specific formats is important.
