Consistency means data across all systems reflects the same information and are in synch with each other across the enterprise. Examples:

A business unit status is closed but there are sales for that business unit.
Employee status is terminated but pay status is active.
Questions you can ask yourself: Are data values the same across the data sets? Are there any distinct occurrences of the same data instances that provide conflicting information?
